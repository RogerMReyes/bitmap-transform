## Lab 04 Reading and Writing BMP file
Estimate of time needed to complete: 5 hour

Start time: 4:00pm

Finish time: 9:00pm

Actual time needed to complete: 5 hours

Summary: In this lab we dived into how to read from a bmp file and how to alter it data in order to transform the image that it displayed. We got really far into reading and writing using the Files class path until Abdullah found out about BufferImage which made the process a lot easier. We were able to alter the image in a couple of ways such as change the white background and construct jail bars. We still have to fully implement the CLI in order for the user to pass the files and transform argument. Currently, we have everything hard coded to make testing easier.
